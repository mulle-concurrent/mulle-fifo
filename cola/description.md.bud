Written for dual-thread configurations. There is a collection of hardcoded size
FIFOs and there is a FIFO which size can be set at runtime.

You can not store NULL pointers into the FIFOs.

There are FIFOs of sizes 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192.
You can easily create your own custom size.
